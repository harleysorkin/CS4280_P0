Program Overview:
This program written in C/C++ creates a BST from a given input file, or from keyboard inputs. The purpose of this project is to act as a programming standards and practices refreshment.

Code used in this project is derrived from previous code I wrote for classes (3010 and 2750).

Invocation:
The program is invoked with the following commands:

./P0			-> Reads input from the keyboard
./P0 < "somefile"	-> Reads input from specified file "somefile"
./P0 "somefile"		-> Reads input from "somefile".cs4280

*"somefile" to be replaced by your file name

The project comes with a Makefile. Use 'make' to create the executable and 'make clean' to remove targets, executables, and output files.

Outputs:
All outputs will be found in "somefile".preorder, "somefile".inorder, and "somefile".postorder, respectively according to the type of traversal. Default is "outP0" should no input filename be give.
